Note: 	The WinCE 5.0 CETK One-Card Network Card Miniport Driver Test has 
	one problem as described below:
	The CETK server will be disconnected with the target device every time 
	while the 1c_SuspendResume test is going to the point as descibed below. 
	Because the CETK server is already disconnected with the target device, 
	the test results file will not be created by the CETK server even though 
	all of the One-Card Network Card Miniport Driver Test items are completed 
	with any errors. This issue is also happened on NE2000 adapter loaded 
	with WinCE 5.0 default "NE2000-compatible [ISA card]" driver. 
	So I assume this is an CETK 5.0 issue.

Solutions:
	This issue has been confirmed to be a CETK 5.0 issue by Microsoft CETK team. 
	They will fix this issue in the future. Below are the solutions to avoid 
	this situation suggested by Microsoft,
	      
	1. Make sure the CETK Clientside.exe program is NOT currently running on
	   your device.
	2. Start Windows CE Test Kit (CETK) on the desktop machine.
	3. Select "Start client..." from the "Connection" menu.
	4. On the "Device Connection" dialog, make sure the "Use Windows Sockets
	   for the client/server communication." checkbox is NOT checked.
	5. Click "Connect..." to get the connection to Windows CE target device.
	6. On the "Select a Windows CE Device" dialog, select the device you are
	   connecting to (typically "Default Device") and click OK.
	7. Select "Windows CE Device Driver Test Kit" and click right mouse key 
	   to select "Deselect All Tests".
	8. Expand the "Ethernet" test items under "Windows CE Device Driver Test Kit".
	9. Select "One-Card Network Card Miniport Driver Test" and click right mouse key 
	   to select "Edit Command Line...". Enter <tux -o -d ndt_1c -c "-t AX881781">
	   command on the Edit Command Line dialog and click OK.	   
	10.Select "Windows CE Device Driver Test Kit" and click right mouse key
